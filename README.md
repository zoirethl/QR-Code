## My Process
### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Finally mastered the easy process of importing fonts from Google (it wasn't working for me before because I wasn't choosing the right properties)
- Gained more practice using flexbox.

### Continued development

- Is there a way to pick up the color directly from an image reference? (and I mean... without going to far, like using external apps)It doesn't seem that my background matches the exact color requested. Mental note to review in the future!ðŸ§
